    Drag coefficents determined by applying a fixed wrench of 500 newtons or 500 newton meters until
    a max velocity was reached at Lake Wauberg. The following results:

    direction  | velocity  | wrench
    _______________________________
    x          | 1.4600396 | 500
    y          | 0.636595  | 500
    z-rotation | 0.24204   | 500
    Each drag coefficient is approximated as wrench / velocity
